For this project we were require to work with MySQL creating a database.

The minimum requirements were to be able to view all employees, all departments, all roles, as well as add a department or role or employee and update an employees role.

We were given the queires in one file and needed to complete them in order to create the connection and return the info requested.

The other .js file held the functions that generated the prompts for each specific request chosen. They would then await to receive the retrieved info from the db index.js and show it in the console.

I have also added a seeds file to show what was done within my DB.

I have preformed the minimum requirements so far but will be continuing and updating this oriject to gain more skills and knowledge.
