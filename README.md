For this project we were require to work with MySQL creating a database.

The minimum requirements were to be able to view all employees, all departments, all roles, as well as add a department or role or employee and update an employees role.

We were given the queires in one file and needed to complete them in order to create the connection and return the info requested.

The other .js file held the functions that generated the prompts for each specific request chosen. They would then await to receive the retrieved info from the db index.js and show it in the console.

I have also added a seeds file to show what was done within my DB.

I have added the remove role and remove department functions as well as view employee by role and department. Now I just need to work on them a bit more to get them to work properly.

-- since submitting this assignment on August 15th,
I have worked on this assignment to get the remove employee, remove dept and remove role to work properly.
I was also able to update the remployees role.

Right now I am working on completing the update employee manager, view mangager and create a function for view all employees by role.
